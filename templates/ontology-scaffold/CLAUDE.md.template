# {PROJECT_NAME} — Claude Code Directives

**Domain:** {DOMAIN_DESCRIPTION}

This extends the global `/projects/CLAUDE.md`. Reference material is in
`.claude/rules/` (auto-loaded every session).

## 1. Work Prioritization

**Stakeholder:** {STAKEHOLDER}
**Task source:** {TASK_SOURCE}

### Priority Rules

1. **{TASK_SOURCE} is source of truth.** Check for open tasks before starting
   new work.
2. **Read before write.** Verify current state before making changes.
3. {PRIORITY_RULE_3}
4. {PRIORITY_RULE_4}

### Communication Style

{COMMUNICATION_PREFERENCES}

---

## 2. Mode Selection

### Task Classification

- {SYNTHESIS_TRIGGER}
  → **InformationSynthesis mode**
  - Ceiling: claims are provisional (for orientation)
  - Lighter requirements: cite sources, note recency

- {CREATION_TRIGGER}
  → **Implementation mode**
  - Required: validation gates, assumption enumeration
  - Full workflow: verify state → plan → execute → verify

### Escalation Triggers (InformationSynthesis → Implementation)

- User asks to modify anything (create, update, delete)
- Breaking changes or contradictions discovered
- {ESCALATION_TRIGGER_3}

### Fail-safe: When uncertain, default to **Implementation** mode.

---

## 3. LLM Boundary

### Claude MAY

- Propose approaches and generate code
- Interpret outputs, logs, and error messages
- Suggest configurations and documentation
- Generate formatted outputs and reports

### Claude SHOULD NOT

- Claim any output is "validated" without human review and gate passage
- Skip validation gate checks (rules/validation-gates.md is mandatory)
- Assign authority scores to sources (use deterministic formula in
  rules/authority-scoring.md)
- {SHOULD_NOT_ADDITIONAL}

### Claude MUST

- Report deterministic metrics without editorializing on their sufficiency
- Enumerate assumptions for every claim (from rules/assumption-registry.md)
- Document decision provenance: `llm_proposed` / `user_directed` /
  `convention` / `stakeholder_directed`
- {MUST_ADDITIONAL}

---

## 4. Workflow Convention

### Before Starting Work

1. Check {TASK_SOURCE} for open tasks
2. Reference task ID in all commits and documentation
3. {WORKFLOW_STEP_3}

### For Significant Changes

1. Reference task + approach documentation
2. List constraints applied (from rules/domain-constraints.md)
3. Enumerate assumptions (from rules/assumption-registry.md)
4. Run validation gates (rules/validation-gates.md)
5. {WORKFLOW_STEP_5}

---

## 5. Key Invariants

These MUST be followed regardless of where the full explanation lives:

- {INVARIANT_1}
- {INVARIANT_2}
- {INVARIANT_3}
- {INVARIANT_4}
- {INVARIANT_5}
