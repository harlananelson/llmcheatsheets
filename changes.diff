+# LLM-Friendly Quarto Cheatsheets & Starters
+
+This repo is a compact set of **LLM-friendly references and templates** for writing Quarto docs (reports, papers, books) and running a **diff-first edit loop** with an LLM.
+
+## What’s here
+- `quarto_llm_cheatsheet.qmd` – copy-pastable reference for CLI, YAML, figures/tables, cross-refs, citations, books, interactive docs, and journal workflows.
+- `research-paper-starter-pack/` – a ready-to-render manuscript scaffold (DOCX/PDF; CSL/BibTeX wired).
+- `LLM_USAGE.md` – how to load this repo as context for an LLM and run a **diff-first** editorial loop.
+
+## Quick start
+1. Clone the repo.
+2. Open `LLM_USAGE.md` and follow the “Project instructions” block when starting an LLM session.
+3. For papers, start in `research-paper-starter-pack/`, add your CSL + Word reference doc, then:
+   ```bash
+   quarto render --to docx
+   # optional:
+   # quarto render --to pdf
+   ```
+
